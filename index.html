          I’m a trans photographer, software engineer, and archivist. My
          pronouns are she/her or it/its, whichever you feel most comfortable
          using. I live in beautiful, sunny Seattle, Washington. I love 1970s
          Swiss graphic design, philately, trains, and my Triumph Bonneville
          T100 motorcycle.

            >Inter,</a
          >
          an experimental and open-source typeface created in 2016 by Rasmus
          Andersson. Inter was designed specifically for computer-screens, with
          the intent of crafting highly-readable user interfaces. It's a
          beautifully clear but subtle typeface that departs from the
          all-encompassing use of Helvetica.
